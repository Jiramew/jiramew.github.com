This post will show you how to compose little songs by [Figure](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/figure/)     
Here is a little song created by myself:    
<embed src="/assets/song/Happy.aif" width=300 height=60 type=audio/x-ms-wma controls="ControlPanel" autostart="false" loop="false" hidden="false"></embed>     
(Maybe you need a chrome, firefox or IE and the extension for Windows Media Player)
