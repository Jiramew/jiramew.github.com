This post will show Some __basic knowledge__ about SQL.

1.    * A __Database__ is a container that holds tables and SQL structures related to those tables.
    * A __column__ is a piece of data stored by your table. A __row__ is a single set of columns that describe attributes of a single thing. Columns and rows together make up a table.
    * __Field__ and column means the same thing, Also row and __record__ are often used interchangably.


2.    * Use `mysql -u root -p` in cmd to launch into the MySQL environment. Or open the cmd with Administrator privileges.
    * `CREATE DATABASE gregs_list;` will create a database called "gregs_list".
    * Then `USE gregs_list;` to actually use the database you just created.
