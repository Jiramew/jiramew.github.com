This post will show you how the blog was created with the help from Jekyll   
##Approach One 
----   
  
1. First thing: Get Everything in your computer   
You should have got a `Github` account, which you can register [here](https://github.com/)   
2. Move to <http://jekyllbootstrap.com/>   
Download and Install `Jelly-Bootstrap` on your `Github` repository and follow the steps   
##Approach Two   
----   

1. You should register a `Github` account and install `Git`   
Installing Jekyll is easy and straight-forward, but there are a few requirements youâ€™ll need to make sure your system has before you start.
<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/'>Ruby</a></li>
<li><a href='http://rubygems.org/pages/download'>RubyGems</a></li>
<li>Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X</li>
</ul>    
2. you can run the following command to install `Jekyll` very simply
{% highlight objc %}
$ gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}    
3. You can push it into your `github page`
{% highlight objc %}
$ git remote add username
$ git push username
{% endhighlight %}
